At this point, we support Etsy and Shopify but will be\nintegrating several more channels, and you will always be able to connect\nas many shops as you like to the same Vela account.\n"},{"question":"Do I have to select a plan for each shop?","anchor":null,"answer":"Yes. Pricing is based per shop, not per Vela account, so if you were to\nconnect three shops, you would have to select a plan for each.\n"},{"question":"Can I choose different plans for each shop?","anchor":null,"answer":"Yes. Each shop is billed separately, so if you connected two shops, one\ncould be on Vela Lite, and the other could be on Vela Plus.\n"},{"question":"Can I switch plans at any time?","anchor":null,"answer":"Yes. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel plans for any shop at any time.\nBilling occurs monthly, so if you downgrade or cancel, you will continue\nto receive access for the remainder of the billing cycle.\n"},{"question":"Do I receive a one-week free trial for each shop?","anchor":null,"answer":"Yes. Every time you connect a new shop, you will receive full access to\nall functionality for an entire week.\n"},{"question":"Does Vela sell or share my data with anyone else?","anchor":null,"answer":"Absolutely not! All data collected is securely managed by Vela and is only\nused to support the platform’s stated functionality.\n"},{"question":"I have more questions. Who should I contact?","anchor":null,"answer":"Feel free to reach out at any time via [contact@getvela.com](mailto:contact@getvela.com), and we’ll\nbe in touch ASAP.\n"}]}},"pageContext":{}},
